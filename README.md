# Number-Guessing-System
The Number Guessing System is an interactive Python-based game designed using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The core objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range, which in this version is from 1 to 50. The system provides real-time feedback to the user’s input, indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. It includes a countdown timer of 10 seconds to increase the challenge, and sound effects using the winsound module to enhance user engagement. The game also tracks the number of attempts made by the user and allows the game to be reset at any time. This simple yet effective system demonstrates key programming concepts such as event-driven programming, random number generation, GUI design, and basic user interaction, making it an ideal beginner-level Python project.
The Number Guessing System is an interactive game developed using Python and the Tkinter library for GUI design. The main objective of the system is to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 50. The player is given a 10-second countdown timer to enter their guess, adding an element of urgency and excitement to the game. After each guess, the system provides real-time feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Additionally, sound alerts are played using the winsound module to enhance user engagement — error tones for wrong guesses and a success tone when the correct number is guessed. The application also tracks the number of attempts made and displays them, allowing users to monitor their performance.
This project demonstrates several fundamental programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional logic, event-driven programming, and graphical user interface design. It also emphasizes user experience by offering a clean interface, easy-to-use input fields, and reset
